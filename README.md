# awesome-deep-learning-for-program-synthesis
A curated list of papers related to deep learning for program synthesis.

"The ability to automatically synthesize code has numerous applications, ranging from helping end-users (non-technical users) write programs, helping software developers synthesize mundane pieces of code or optimized code, helping data scientists clean up and explore data, to helping algorithm designers discover new algorithms."


These are some papers and research directions that got me excited. This is WIP! I will organize this come term break.
